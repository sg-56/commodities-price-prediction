## Introduction
Predicting the prices of essential commodities such as food grains, vegetables, and other daily necessities is crucial for economic stability and planning. This project focuses on building robust predictive models to forecast commodity prices in Karnataka using data science techniques.

## Data Collection
Data is gathered from the following sources:
- Historical price data from government databases and market reports.


## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves:
- Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and erroneous data entries.
- Integration: Combining data from multiple sources.
- Transformation: Normalizing and scaling data.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features such as lagged variables, moving averages, and seasonal indicators.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA techniques used include:
- Descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.
- Visualization (time series plots, box plots, scatter plots) to identify trends and patterns.
- Correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between variables.

## Model Building
Various models are built and tested, including:
- Machine Learning Models: Decision trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.
- Deep Learning Models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, RNNs.

## Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

## Model Deployment
Considerations for deployment include:
- Real-time predictions
- User-friendly dashboards and visualizations
- Scalability for handling large datasets and regular updates

## Monitoring and Maintenance
Ongoing processes include:
- Performance monitoring and recalibration
- Continuous data updates
- Incorporating user feedback for model improvement
